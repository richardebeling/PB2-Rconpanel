This is a remote administration tool for Digital Paint: Paintball 2 servers.

No installation is required, simply run the executable.
Settings will be stored in an .ini file next to the binary.
To uninstall, simply remove the binary and the .ini file.

The main window shows connected players and allows performing admin tasks.
You can also perform manual rcon communication with the server here.
There are dialogs for changing the rotation and banned IP addresses.
There's also an Auto-Kick feature based on high pings, player IDs, or names.
